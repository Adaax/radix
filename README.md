At last! The forgotten console of the 1980s returns!

Radix was a home video game console released in 1982 by Dynamic Solutions Inc, based out of Actontown in Upstate New York. It was sold largely out of the Fast Electronics chain of stores, which were widespread in the area at that time (but closed down long ago).
